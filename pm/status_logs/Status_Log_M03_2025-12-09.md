# Status Log - M03 - 2025-12-09

- Propagated actor metadata from EF-07 taxonomy routes into the service so capture events and metrics include API-supplied identities (pulled from `X-Actor-Id` / `X-Actor-Source` headers with safe defaults).
- Added `get_actor_context` helper plus unit coverage so downstream routers can stay consistent without duplicating header parsing logic.
- Follow-up: replace the logging/in-memory observability stubs with the real INF-03 capture bus and metrics backend once those adapters land; continue forwarding actor headers to preserve audit trails.
