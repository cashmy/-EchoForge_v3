# Status Log — M02 — 2025-12-09 18:20 UTC

## 1. Context
- Milestone: M02 — Processing Pipeline
- Active Task: M02-T12 (ETS rehearsal procedure + coverage)
- Artifacts Updated: `tests/README.md`, `tests/ets/test_pipeline_harness.py`, `tests/helpers/pipeline_harness.py`, `scripts/ets_runner.py`

## 2. What Was Attempted
- Authored the operator-facing ETS rehearsal procedure (pre-flight gating, scenario execution, verification, and logging expectations) directly in `tests/README.md`.
- Re-ran the automated harness sweep (`py -m pytest tests/ets -vv`) to capture the current ETS coverage baseline prior to manual rehearsals.

## 3. Outcomes / Coverage
- README now documents the exact sequence operators must follow (setup scripts, watcher invocation, worker handle snippets, telemetry checks, and status-log requirements) so the final T12 rehearsal can be repeated verbatim.
- Automated harness results: `tests/ets/test_pipeline_harness.py` → **3 passed** (audio happy path, document happy path, semantic failure). Logs recorded under the ETS harness marker confirm INF-03 telemetry for success + failure paths.
- Pre-flight commands validated deterministic fixtures + unit logging sweeps, so the repository is ready for the manual ETS walkthrough when operators schedule it.

## 4. Issues / Blockers
- None. Manual rehearsal still needs to be executed and captured, but all documentation and harness prerequisites are now in place.

## 5. Next Steps
- Follow the documented procedure to run each matrix scenario (A1, D1, R1, F1, S1, I1) against the real watch roots/INF-02 queue, then append the scenario-specific evidence to this log before marking M02-T12 as done.
