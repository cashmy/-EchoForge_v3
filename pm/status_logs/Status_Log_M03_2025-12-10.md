# Status Log - M03 - 2025-12-10

- Finished VT05 by adding FastAPI-level taxonomy CRUD tests (`tests/unit/test_taxonomy_api.py`) plus expanded service instrumentation coverage; suite exercises create/list flows, delete gating, reactivation, and actor header propagation.
- Updated router annotations to satisfy FastAPI 0.115 validation (Query defaults, delete handlers, Path pattern) so API and tests share the same runtime behavior.
- ETS alignment: the new tests map to `ETS-API-TAX-01` (CRUD contract, delete warnings) and prep groundwork for `ETS-DB-TAX-03`; next step is to hook these cases into the ETS harness once MG06 work begins.
- Closed T06 planning after finalizing the capture payload blueprint, PATCH contract, governance notes, and ETS matrix in `pm/milestone_tasks/M03_T06_Subtask_Plan.md`; next action is to execute the documented PATCH implementation.
- Delivered T07 UI retrieval: `/api/healthz` now exposes taxonomy feature flags, the SPA hydrates `/api/types|/api/domains` via `useTaxonomyStore`, the new `TaxonomyConsole` renders dropdowns/inactive chips/custom labels, and Vitest coverage (`useTaxonomyStore.test.ts`) verifies cache + refresh flows.
- Per ops feedback, the taxonomy console now stays hidden by default—`config/profiles/{dev,desktop}.yaml` ship with `enable_taxonomy_refs_in_capture=false`, `App.tsx`/Dashboard gate rendering off until the flag flips, and the status card shows a disabled badge + UX notice so the feature can be reintroduced once capture workflows stabilize.
- `npm run test -- --run` (Vitest 2.1.9) re-validated the taxonomy store cache + refresh logic; both specs passed in ~2s with telemetry logs confirming successful `/api/types|/api/domains` hydrations. Noted npm's warning about legacy user configs (`python`, `Files\\nodejs\\node_modules\\node-gyp\\bin`) so we can clean those up before the next npm major.
- Completed M03-T09 ST04 benchmarks: seeded 2k entries, captured `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` plans showing `IDX_entries_type_id`/`IDX_entries_domain_type` index scans (0.34 ms and 0.06 ms respectively), and logged `pg_stat_user_indexes` usage counts via helper scripts under `scripts/`. Evidence attached to the subtask plan for MG06 review.
- Landed the taxonomy ETS harness deliverables for M03-T10 ST04/ST05: shared helpers now live in `scripts/taxonomy_harness.py`, the ETS profile (`python scripts/ets_runner.py --profile taxonomy`) documents env requirements in `tests/README.md`, and the new `tests/ets/test_taxonomy_db_indexes.py` test proves the EF-06 indexes appear in `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` output + `pg_stat_user_indexes`. MG06 + MI99 breadcrumbs call out the rerun steps so governance has a reproducible recipe.
- M03 wrap-up: T01–T09 deliverables are in production (schemas, migrations, API, UI, ETS). T10 ETS profile green; residual risk limited to feature-flag reintroduction of the Taxonomy Console (tracked via MI99-T13). Upcoming actions: (a) capture taxonomy philosophy decisions (T12), (b) re-run the taxonomy ETS profile before MG06 kickoff, (c) execute MI99-T12 full test sweep once UI flag enablement is reviewed.
- MI99-T12 verification (2025-12-10 23:xx UTC):
	- `D:/@EchoForge_v3/.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest tests/unit` → 87 passed in 1.92s.
	- `D:/@EchoForge_v3/.venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/ets_runner.py --profile taxonomy` → CRUD+patch ETS scenarios passed; DB index test auto-skipped (no `ETS_TAXONOMY_DB_URL`).
