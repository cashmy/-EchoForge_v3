# Status Log - M03 - 2025-12-10

- Finished VT05 by adding FastAPI-level taxonomy CRUD tests (`tests/unit/test_taxonomy_api.py`) plus expanded service instrumentation coverage; suite exercises create/list flows, delete gating, reactivation, and actor header propagation.
- Updated router annotations to satisfy FastAPI 0.115 validation (Query defaults, delete handlers, Path pattern) so API and tests share the same runtime behavior.
- ETS alignment: the new tests map to `ETS-API-TAX-01` (CRUD contract, delete warnings) and prep groundwork for `ETS-DB-TAX-03`; next step is to hook these cases into the ETS harness once MG06 work begins.
- Closed T06 planning after finalizing the capture payload blueprint, PATCH contract, governance notes, and ETS matrix in `pm/milestone_tasks/M03_T06_Subtask_Plan.md`; next action is to execute the documented PATCH implementation.
