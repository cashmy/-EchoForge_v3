# Status Log - M03 - 2025-12-10

- Finished VT05 by adding FastAPI-level taxonomy CRUD tests (`tests/unit/test_taxonomy_api.py`) plus expanded service instrumentation coverage; suite exercises create/list flows, delete gating, reactivation, and actor header propagation.
- Updated router annotations to satisfy FastAPI 0.115 validation (Query defaults, delete handlers, Path pattern) so API and tests share the same runtime behavior.
- ETS alignment: the new tests map to `ETS-API-TAX-01` (CRUD contract, delete warnings) and prep groundwork for `ETS-DB-TAX-03`; next step is to hook these cases into the ETS harness once MG06 work begins.
- Closed T06 planning after finalizing the capture payload blueprint, PATCH contract, governance notes, and ETS matrix in `pm/milestone_tasks/M03_T06_Subtask_Plan.md`; next action is to execute the documented PATCH implementation.
- Delivered T07 UI retrieval: `/api/healthz` now exposes taxonomy feature flags, the SPA hydrates `/api/types|/api/domains` via `useTaxonomyStore`, the new `TaxonomyConsole` renders dropdowns/inactive chips/custom labels, and Vitest coverage (`useTaxonomyStore.test.ts`) verifies cache + refresh flows.
- Per ops feedback, the taxonomy console now stays hidden by default—`config/profiles/{dev,desktop}.yaml` ship with `enable_taxonomy_refs_in_capture=false`, `App.tsx`/Dashboard gate rendering off until the flag flips, and the status card shows a disabled badge + UX notice so the feature can be reintroduced once capture workflows stabilize.
- Completed M03-T09 ST04 benchmarks: seeded 2k entries, captured `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` plans showing `IDX_entries_type_id`/`IDX_entries_domain_type` index scans (0.34 ms and 0.06 ms respectively), and logged `pg_stat_user_indexes` usage counts via helper scripts under `scripts/`. Evidence attached to the subtask plan for MG06 review.
