# Decision Record — 2025-12-10 — M04-T08 Blocked Pending Frontend Readiness

## Context
- M04-T08 (“Implement ETS Cases for Dashboards & Search”) depends on `/api/entries` (T05) and UI wiring (T06) being ready so ETS scenarios can exercise real filter combinations and dashboard behaviors.
- Backend work completed to date covers `/api/dashboard/summary`, EF-06 indexes, and supporting Postman artifacts. `/api/entries` implementation + UI remain deferred until frontend resources are available.

## Decision
- Mark M04-T08 as **blocked** until T05 and T06 are delivered. T08 will not proceed in isolation.
- Track T05–T07 (and the resulting T08 unblock) via MI99 backlog items T15–T17.
- Status reflected in `pm/milestone_tasks/M04_Dashboard_Search_Aggregation_Tasks_v1.0.md` and `pm/status_logs/Status_Log_M04_2025-12-10.md`.

## Rationale
1. ETS cases require concrete `/api/entries` behavior (query builder, validation, pagination) which is not yet implemented.
2. UI wiring informs real-world usage patterns and zero-state handling, both of which influence ETS acceptance criteria.
3. Documenting the block avoids confusion when resuming M04 or planning MG06/07 governance work.

## Follow-Up Actions
- Resume T05/T06 when frontend work begins; remove the block on T08 once backend + UI pieces stabilize.
- Update MI99 backlog entries (T15–T17) as milestones progress.
- Re-run ETS planning session when `/api/entries` endpoint is available for testing.
